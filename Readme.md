# Software Engineer Learning Roadmap

> The technology work is change so fast today, all kinds of new technologies come the market everyday. As a software engineer, either it's driven by self interests or career developent, I always eager to learn more about existing and new technologies. 
>
> However, during my learning process I found there are two things always borthers me. One is that all my paper based notes are hard to access and navigate. Sometimes I could not even remember which note book I have the knowledge I want to search for. Another issue is that learning without a high level overview of the relations between different technologies and how they build up a systematic knowldege base like Fountend, Backend e.g. This always causing learning duplicated knowledges and not knowing the missing piece in the system.
>
> So, here is a roadmap to help myself to systematicly learn the technologies. 

I did some search in GitHub and found [developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) and [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). These two repositories fit my ideas very well. However, there are still some work need to be done. 

The developper-roadmap has comprehensive and detailed information about technologies for Frontend, Backend and DevOP. It just missing the real learning materials. So in this repo, I will add in the learning content I found that is useful. Also, I can use this as a checklist to track the learning progress.

The coding-interview-university has a lot of materials, and the content has been well organized by the autor. So not much work on that part. What I will do is to move the content around to fit my own study plan better.

This will be long running project, maybe monthes or even years. I am very excited to build this project as well as learning a long the way!!!

Cheers.
