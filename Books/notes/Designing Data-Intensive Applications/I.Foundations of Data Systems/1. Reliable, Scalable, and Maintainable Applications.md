# 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
## Reliability
>The System should continue to work correctly even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults and even human error)
* Hardware Faults 
  * hard disks - RAID configuration
  * servers - dual power supplies and hot swappable CPUs
  * datacenters - batteries and diesel generators
* Software Faults
  * bugs
  * process that use up shared resource (CPU time, memory, disl space, network bandwidth)
  * services that the system depends on that slow down, become unresponsive, or starts returnning corrupted responses
  * cascading failures, where a small fault in one components triggers a fault in another component
  * Solutions: thorough testing, process isolation, allowing processes to crash and restart, measuring, monitoring
* Human Errors
  * Design systesm in a way that minimize opportunities for error
  * Decouple the places where people make the most mistakes from the places where they can cause failures. e.g. non-production sand box enbironments
  * Test thoroughly at all levels, from unit-tests to whole-system integration tests and mannual tests
  * Allow quick and easy recovery from human errors, fast to roll back, roll out new code gradually, provide tools to recompute data
  * Set up detailed and clear monitoring, such as performence metrics and error rate
  * Implement good management practices and training
## Scalability
>As the system grows, there should be reasonable ways of dealing with the growth.
* Describing Load
  * We need to succinctly describe the current load on the system, then can we discuss growth questions
  * Load Parameters
    * request per second to a web server
    * ratio of reads to writes in a database
    * number of simultaneously active users in a chat room
    * hit rate on a cache
* Describing Performance
  * When you increase a load parameter and keep the system reources unchanged, how is the performance of your system affected?
  * When you increase a load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resource if you want to keep performance unchanged?
  * Use percentiles to describe the performance of a response time
## Maintainability
>Over time, many different people will work on the system, and they should all be able to work on it productively.
* Operability
  * Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly
* Simplicity
  * Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system
* Evolvability
  * Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, also known as extensibility, modifiability, or plasticity
