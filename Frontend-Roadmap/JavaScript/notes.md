# JavaScript Basic Concepts
### Basic Types
  - number (integer, floating, infinity, -infinity, NaN) 
  - string
  - boolean (true / false)
  - null (if checked by 'typeof' operator, will return 'object' which is an known error)
  - undefined
  - symbol
  - object (function is also object)
### Falsy values
  - undefined
  - null
  - NaN
  - 0
  - '' (empty string)
### Truthy values
  - Anything that is not falsy
### == VS ===
  - == : does type coercion. e.g. 23 == '23' is true
  - === : does of do type coercion. e.g. 23 === '23' is false
